<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://picsum.photos/100/100">

Brigade is a Telegram-based trading bot designed for trading on Solana platforms, specifically Pump.fun and Raydium. Brigade offers two primary trading modes:

1. **Single Wallet Trading** - Trade using a single fund wallet.
2. **Multi-Wallet Trading** - Trade using up to 25 wallets simultaneously, with centralized management.

**Key Features:**

* **Multi-Wallet Trading:** Manage and trade with up to 25 wallets simultaneously, with transactions appearing human-like due to the absence of Jito bundles, avoiding detection by bubble maps.
* **Sniper Mode, Copy Trading, and Auto Buy/Sell Modes:** Advanced trading strategies with automated settings.
* **Free to Use:** No paywall or requirement to provide your own Solana RPC node.
* **Dedicated RPC Nodes:** Provided by Brigade for fast and reliable transactions.
* **1% Transaction Fee:** Applied to all trades conducted through the bot.
