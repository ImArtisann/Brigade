# Settings

The **Settings Menu** in Brigade allows users to configure essential trading options, including transaction speeds, buy/sell preferences, wallet management, and priority settings. Users can set specific configurations for each trading mode.

#### Menu Options

1. **Trading Modes**:
   * There are four options to configure your settings based on different trading modes:
     * **Main**: Configure default settings used during regular transactions.
     * **Auto**: Set up auto-buy, auto-sell, and random buy settings for automated trading.
     * **Copy**: Customize settings for copy trading, where the bot mirrors trades from selected wallets.
     * **Snipe**: Add developer wallets to snipe new tokens immediately after they launch.
2. **Wallets**:
   * This option opens the **Wallets Menu**, where users can manage wallet-related functions:
     * Send SOL to fund or buy wallets.
     * Retrieve SOL from buy wallets to the fund wallet.
     * Send SOL to any Solana address.

#### Buy Settings

* **Preset Buy Amounts**: Choose from preset SOL amounts for quick buy transactions:
  * Options include **0.5 SOL**, **1 SOL**, **3 SOL**, and **5 SOL**.
* **Custom Buy Amount (0.1 SOL)**: Set a specific custom SOL amount for buys.
* **Random Buy**: Define a random SOL range for buys (e.g., 0.1 SOL to 0.5 SOL). This feature adds variability to trades, making them appear more human-like.

#### Sell Settings

* **Preset Sell Percentages**: Choose from predefined sell percentages of your token holdings:
  * Options include **2%**, **5%**, **10%**, **25%**, **50%**, **75%**, and **100%**.
* **Custom Sell Percentage**: Enter a specific percentage to sell, giving you precise control over the amount to liquidate.
* **Auto Sell Slip**: Set the default slippage tolerance for auto-sell transactions, ensuring transactions execute only within acceptable price ranges.

#### Priority Settings

* **Trade Speeds**: Select from three predefined priority fee speeds for trades, or set a custom priority:
  * **Normal**: Low speed with lower fees (average 55% confirmation).
  * **Turbo**: Medium speed with moderate fees (average 75% confirmation).
  * **Lightspeed**: Highest speed with higher fees (average 95% confirmation).
  * **Custom**: Set a custom priority fee based on current network conditions.

#### Additional Options

* **Select Auto Wallets**: At the bottom of the menu, users in multi-wallet mode can select which wallets will participate in automated trading (auto-buy/sell).
