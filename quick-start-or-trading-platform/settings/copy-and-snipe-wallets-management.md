# Copy and Snipe Wallets Management

Within the **Copy** and **Snipe** settings tabs, users have the ability to add or remove wallets that the bot will use for these respective trading modes. This allows users to manage the specific wallets they want to include for copy trading or sniping activities.

#### Adding and Removing Wallets

1. **Add/Remove Copy Wallets**
   * **Purpose**: This option lets users add wallets to copy trades from or remove wallets they no longer want to track. When a wallet is added, the bot will automatically mirror trades from this wallet to the userâ€™s selected wallets in **Copy Trading Mode**.
   * **Steps**:
     1. **Add a Wallet**:
        * Tap on **Add Copy Wallets**.
        * Enter the wallet address when prompted. Once entered, the wallet will be added to your list of copy wallets.
     2. **Remove a Wallet**:
        * Tap on the **Remove** button next to the wallet you wish to delete.
        * Confirm the removal if prompted. This will stop the bot from mirroring trades from that wallet.
     3. **Remove All Wallets**:
        * Tap on **Remove All** to clear all wallets from the copy list.
        * This is useful if you want to reset your list of copy wallets and start fresh.
2. **Add/Remove Snipe Wallets**
   * **Purpose**: This option allows users to add developer wallets that the bot will snipe from. When a developer wallet is added, the bot will automatically snipe newly created tokens launched from this wallet.
   * **Steps**:
     1. **Add a Wallet**:
        * Tap on **Add Snipe Wallets**.
        * Enter the developer wallet address when prompted. This wallet will now be monitored for new token launches.
     2. **Remove a Wallet**:
        * Tap on the **Remove** button next to the wallet you wish to delete from the sniping list.
     3. **Remove All Wallets**:
        * Tap on **Remove All** to remove all developer wallets from the sniping list, which stops monitoring all listed wallets for new tokens.

#### Buttons and Options

* **Add Copy/Snipe Wallets**: Opens a prompt to input a wallet address. The wallet is then added to either the copy or snipe list based on the selected mode.
* **Remove**: Deletes a specific wallet from the list.
* **Remove All**: Clears all wallets from the list, resetting the configuration for that mode.

#### Using "Select Copy/Snipe Wallets"

In multi-wallet mode, users can also choose which wallets they want to use for **Copy** or **Snipe** trading within their buy wallets. After setting up the desired list of copy or snipe wallets, users can toggle the **Select Copy/Snipe Wallets** option in the main **Settings Menu**.
