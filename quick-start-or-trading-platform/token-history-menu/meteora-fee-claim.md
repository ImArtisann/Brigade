# ðŸ¤‘ Meteora Fee Claim

**Fee Claim Overview**

Brigade now offers an efficient and tax-free process to claim fees generated through locked pool rewards. Users can claim these fees with **zero tax or additional fees**, ensuring that 100% of the rewards earned through locked pool performance go directly to the user.

**Claiming Fees: Multi-Wallet & Single Wallet Support**

Brigade supports two main methods for claiming fees based on wallet structure and user preferences:

1. **Multi-Wallet Claim**:
   * Users can manage and claim fees across **multiple wallets** (up to 25) in a single operation.
   * This is particularly useful for users with multiple wallets that qualify for top 50% locked pool rewards.
   * A consolidated menu provides control over all linked wallets, allowing users to efficiently claim fees from each wallet simultaneously.
2. **Single Wallet Claim**:
   * If only one of your wallets qualifies for top 50% holder rewards, you can initiate a claim from that wallet directly.
   * The process is streamlined to ensure quick and seamless fee extraction.

**Eligibility for Fee Claiming**

* **Top 50% Pool Holders**: To claim fees, your wallet(s) must rank within the **top 50% of pool holders**. Brigade automatically tracks wallet performance and pool rankings, ensuring easy identification of eligible wallets.

**No Tax or Additional Fees**

* Brigade ensures that **no additional fees** or **taxes** are applied when claiming your rewards. The full value of the earned fees is credited directly to your wallet.

**Steps to Claim Fees**

1. **Navigate to the Wallet Dashboard** in Brigade.
2. **Select Single or Multi-Wallet Claim**:
   * For **multi-wallet claims**, use the main control menu to manage and select eligible wallets.
   * For **single wallet claims**, simply select the eligible wallet and initiate the claim.
3. Confirm the claim and receive your rewards **with no tax or additional fees** deducted.

This new feature simplifies the fee-claiming process, making it easier for Brigade users to access their rewards and maximize their locked pool earnings.
