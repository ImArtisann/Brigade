# ðŸ’° Initializing Brigade

## **Step 1: Add the Bot on Telegram**

* Search for the username `@BrigadeCrypto_Bot` on Telegram or use the link: [BrigadeCrypto\_Bot](https://t.me/BrigadeCrypto\_Bot?start=ref\_2133526690).
* Click `Start` or use the `/start` command to initiate the bot.

## **Step 2: Select Trading Mode**

* The bot starts with a main menu displaying options for **Fund Wallet Mode** or **Buy Wallet Mode**. Users can switch between these modes by clicking the `Click Here` hyper link-button next to the displayed trade mode.
* You can also swap between modes by using command /mode

## **Step 3: Fund Wallets**

* **Fund Wallet Mode:** Fund your main wallet to begin trading.
* **Buy Wallet Mode:** Ensure the fund wallet is funded to distribute SOL to buy wallets. The bot supports generating up to 25 buy wallets, with free users limited to 5.

## **Step 4: Start Trading**

* No additional setup like API keys, Solana wallets, or RPC configuration is needed. Brigade provides all the necessary infrastructure.
