The bot will then ask you how many wallets you would like to generate! the default amount you can generate at the beginning is 5 buy wallets but you can upgrade that later but generate 5 for now if this is your first time initializing Brigade. The bot will then update you that all you buy wallets have been created and what menu to see those addresses and private keys if you choose to import your buy wallets into phantom also!
