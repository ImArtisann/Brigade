# üñ•Ô∏è Auto Buy / Auto Sell Settings

## **Settings Available:**

1. **Auto Buy SOL Amount**:
   * **Set Buy Amount**: Specify the amount of SOL to be used for automatic buy orders. This setting is particularly useful when using the auto buy feature via commands or through pasted contract addresses in the bot's chat.
2. **Auto Sell Percentage**:
   * **Set Sell Percentage**: Define the percentage of tokens to be automatically sold when a sell condition is triggered. This ensures that the bot can automatically execute sell orders based on pre-configured conditions.
3. **Auto Random Buy Settings**:
   * **Random Buy Range**: Users can set a range (e.g., 0.1 SOL to 0.5 SOL) within which the bot will randomly choose an amount for each buy order. This feature adds variability to the trades, making them appear more human-like and less predictable.
4. **Wallet Selection**:
   * **Select Wallets** (Buy Wallet Mode Only): Users in buy wallet mode can select which wallets to apply these auto settings to. All selected wallets will follow the same automated buy/sell rules.
   * **Select All/Remove All**: Quickly select or deselect all available wallets for the auto settings.
