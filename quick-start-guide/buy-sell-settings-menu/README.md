# üñ•Ô∏è Buy / Sell Settings Menu

## **Settings Available:**

1. **Priority Fee Settings**:
   * **Custom Priority**: Users can set a specific priority fee for their transactions, which influences the transaction's speed and likelihood of confirmation on the Solana network.
   * **Auto Priority**: Instead of manually setting a priority fee, users can opt for an automatic priority system. The bot offers three levels of auto priority:
     * **Medium**: 50% chance of confirming under normal network conditions.
     * **High**: 75% chance of confirming, suitable for slightly congested network conditions.
     * **Very High**: 95% chance of confirming, ideal for highly congested networks.
2. **Slippage Tolerance**:
   * **Slippage Amount**: Set the maximum acceptable percentage for slippage. This setting ensures that trades will only execute if the price change between the order and execution remains within this tolerance range.
3. **Copy Trade Sell Percentage**:
   * **Sell Percentage**: When using the copy trade feature, users can set a default sell percentage for all trades that are mirrored from the copied wallet. This setting determines how much of the token balance should be sold when the copied wallet initiates a sell order.
4. **Copy Trade/Sniper Trade SOL Amount**:
   * **SOL Amount**: Define the amount of SOL to be used when executing a buy order via copy trading or sniping. This setting ensures that all automated trades (through copy or sniper trading) use a consistent SOL amount.
5. **Auto Buy/Auto Sell Settings**:
   * This menu provides options to configure automated buying and selling conditions that the bot will follow without manual intervention. Detailed below in the **Auto Buy/Auto Sell Sub-Menu** section.
